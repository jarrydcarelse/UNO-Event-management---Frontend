## üöÄ Project Overview

Eventify is designed to simplify and optimize the management of events ‚Äî from small gatherings to large-scale conferences. The application provides tools for managing schedules, attendees, and logistics in one cohesive environment. It features a responsive and intuitive interface built using **React** and packaged into a desktop application using **Electron**, with the help of **Avien** for advanced integration and UI functionality.

The development was a collaborative effort among four team members, each contributing to the frontend, integration, and backend logic to ensure a seamless experience.
